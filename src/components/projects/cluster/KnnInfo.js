                K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering is a simple but effective unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data clustering and classification. It groups data points into clusters based on their similarity to their k-nearest neighbors in a feature space. KNN assigns each data point to the cluster that has the majority of its nearest neighbors, making it particularly useful for pattern recognition and data segmentation tasks.
