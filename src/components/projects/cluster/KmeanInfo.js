                K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data clustering. It partitions a dataset into K distinct clusters, where K is a predefined number. The algorithm starts by initializing K centroids, assigns data points to the nearest centroid, updates the centroids based on the mean of the assigned data points, and repeats these steps until convergence or a maximum number of iterations. K-means is widely applied in various domains, including image segmentation, customer segmentation, document clustering, and anomaly detection.
