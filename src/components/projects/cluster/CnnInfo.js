            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm primarily used for image recognition and computer vision tasks. They automatically extract relevant features from input images by applying a series of convolutional, activation, and pooling layers. These hierarchical architectures enable CNNs to learn and classify patterns effectively, making them a powerful tool for tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image classification.
