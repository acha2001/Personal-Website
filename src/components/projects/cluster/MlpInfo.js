            Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple interconnected layers of nodes or neurons. They are capable of learning complex relationships in data through supervised training. MLPs are widely used for both regression and classification tasks in machine learning, and their architecture includes input, hidden, and output layers.
