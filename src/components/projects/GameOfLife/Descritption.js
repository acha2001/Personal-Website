            I initially created this program as a rudimentary 
            command-line utility designed to perpetually display 
            output on the terminal. You can readily access the source
             code for my initial implementation on my GitHub repository, 
             alongside the source code for this website. 
             When I started this project, I was concurrently enrolled in 
             a course on finite automata and another on discrete mathematics. 
             Visualizing this simple concept  
             allows the viewer to fully comprehend its complex behaviors
             of such atomata.</ul>
